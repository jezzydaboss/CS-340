How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?


Throughout this course, I’ve learned how to design software that’s not only functional but maintainable, readable, and adaptable. My CRUD Python module from Project One was a turning point—it allowed me to abstract database operations into clean, reusable methods that I later integrated seamlessly into my Project Two dashboard. This modular approach made it easier to troubleshoot, extend, and connect frontend widgets to backend queries without rewriting logic. It also laid the groundwork for future projects where I might need to connect different datasets or build new dashboards—whether for logistics, inventory, or client reporting. As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first understanding the real-world needs behind the technical requirements. Grazioso Salvare’s request wasn’t just about building a dashboard—it was about helping them identify dogs for life-saving rescue missions. That meant translating operational criteria like breed, age, and location into precise MongoDB queries and designing a user interface that minimized error and maximized clarity. Compared to earlier assignments, this project demanded deeper integration between data modeling, UI/UX, and client goals. It reminded me that computer science isn’t just about writing code—it’s about solving problems that matter. My work helped Grazioso Salvare streamline their selection process, reduce manual effort, and make faster, data-driven decisions. That’s the kind of impact I want to keep delivering.
